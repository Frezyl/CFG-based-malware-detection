# CFG-based-malware-detection

My thesis project, a neural network based classifier, which uses call and control flow graphs extracted from benign programs in IoT firmware and known IoT malware.
The graphs were generated using the angr framework and the classification is done by a modified version of structure2vec (https://github.com/Hanjun-Dai/pytorch_structure2vec).
